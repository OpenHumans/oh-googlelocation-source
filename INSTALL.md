## Deployment to *heroku*.

This is a 5-Step guide to get your own Open Humans data upload project up and running. It does not require neither programming nor command line experience.

### **Step 1**: Click the *deploy to heroku* button above.

Log in into your existing *heroku* account or create a new one. (This Uploader is designed to completely work with the free tier of *heroku*, so you don't have to give them any payment details).

### **Step 2**: Fill out the parameters that *heroku* asks you

(see screenshot below).

![](docs/deploy_heroku.png)

*heroku* asks you to give your app a name, for this demo we use `ohuploadertemplatetest`. Repeat this name below for the `HEROKUCONFIG_APP_NAME`. The second important parameter is the `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. You will later need this to connect your uploader to *Open Humans* and to customize your uploader. Once you have entered this information you click on *deploy app* and after a while you should get a success message.

If you have given `ohuploadertemplatetest` as the `HEROKUCONFIG_APP_NAME` your uploader should be available at `https://ohuploadertemplatetest.herokuapp.com/`.

### **Step 3**: Create your project on *Open Humans*

On *Open Humans* you can create a new project by [clicking on *create a new OAuth2 data request project*](https://www.openhumans.org/direct-sharing/projects/manage/).

![](docs/oh_config.png)

Fill out the form and enter all the required information. The most important to make sure that your uploader will work is the *Redirect URL*, which will be set depending on your *App name*. If your app's main page is `https://ohuploadertemplatetest.herokuapp.com/`, then the `REDIRECT URL` should be `https://ohuploadertemplatetest.herokuapp.com/complete`.

### **Step 4**: Grab your Oauth credentials from *Open Humans*

Once you click on save in **Step 3** you should come back to the list of all projects you are currently running. This should now contain your new project.

![](docs/oh_projects.png)

Click on the name of your new project and this new page you will see your `CLIENT ID` and `CLIENT SECRET`. This are the two missing bits of information that you will need to connect your new *heroku* Uploader app to *Open Humans*.

### **Step 5**: Finalize your Uploader setup

You can now go to `https://HEROKUCONFIG_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/project-admin/login` (replace `HEROKUCONFIG_APP_NAME` with the name you gave in *Step 2*) and use the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you gave in *Step 2* to log in.

![](docs/template_setup.png)

Once logged in you will see a page that gives you all options to edit your template and make it work for your own project. As a most important, first step you should start by clicking `Edit Open Humans settings`. Here you can enter the `CLIENT ID` and `CLIENT SECRET` that you looked up in *Step 4*. Afterwards you can edit more things about your project like:
- the Title & Description
- the metadata used for the uploaded files
- all the texts that should appear on your uploader website.

This last bit is done [by writing Markdown formatted text right into the forms](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).

## Local Deployment and Development
The *Open Humans Uploader* is written in *Python 3.6+*, uses the *Django 2.0* framework and is designed to be ultimately deployed
to *Heroku*. You will need some additional modules and packages to locally experiment with this uploader template or to develop it further. A full step-by-step guide that should work for Mac OS (and with minor differences for Linux) [can be found in the INSTALL.md](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/ftdna-upload/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

# Local Deployment and Development

This tool is designed to be deployed to *heroku* ([see README.md](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/ftdna-upload/blob/master/README.md)). To install it
locally to develop it further (or to deploy to non-heroku hosts) see the guidelines here:

### *Step 1: Install pipenv and needed packages*

This project now [uses the recommended `pipenv` workflow for installing dependencies](http://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

If you already have a `Python` installation on your end do the following to get started with all required Python packages do the following from the main `ftdna-upload` folder:

```
pip install pipenv
pipenv install --three
pipenv shell
```

You should now be in a shell that is specifically set up with all the required Python packages. You can exit this shell any time by just writing `exit`. If new packages have been added to this repository any time, you can upgrade all the packages for it by typing `pipenv install` again and it will use the existing `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` to install the appropriate modules.

### *Step 2: Install Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI)*

You should install the Heroku CLI to run this app locally.
Heroku has [installation instructions for MacOS, Windows, and Linux](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install).

If you are running MacOS the easiest way to do this is using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). After installing Homebrew you have two options:

Simply run:
`brew install heroku/brew/heroku`

Or

```
brew tap heroku/brew
brew install heroku
```

The second option shown above adds the Heroku repository to your Homebrew configuration allowing you to access all of the Heroku library rather than the single `heroku` application.

### *Step 3: Set-up the local `.env` file*
Once this is done you can complete minimal setup by:
* Create an `.env` file from the example: `cp .env.sample .env`
* Edit `.env` to set a random string for `SECRET_KEY` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
* Make sure to activate your `Python` environment with `pipenv shell`
* Migrate your database using `heroku local:run python manage.py migrate`
* Initialize config with `heroku local:run python manage.py init_proj_config`

Now you can run the webserver of your local heroku environment using `heroku local`.

This should give you a development server up and running on `http://0.0.0.0:5000`.
On `http://0.0.0.0:5000/project-admin/` you should fine the project admin interface,
you can login to it using the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you set above.


## FAQ

**When I run `heroku local` or use the app it crashes/complains about missing packages.**

It seems that either new packages are required to run the latest version of `ftdna-upload` or that you're not in the `pipenv shell`. To check for both things run:

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
heroku local
```
The app should start now.

**I get an error about the project config not found!**

You probably forgot the initialization step. Inside your `pipenv shell` run `heroku local:run python manage.py init_proj_config`

**I get an error about tables/columns not found!**

You probably didn't migrate your database. Run `heroku local:run python manage.py migrate` to add the missing database tables/columns.
