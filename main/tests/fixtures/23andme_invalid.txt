# Below is a text version of your data. Fields are TAB-separated
# Each line corresponds to a single SNP.  For each SNP, we provide its identifier
# (an rsid or an internal id), its location on the reference human genome, and the
# genotype call oriented with respect to the plus strand on the human reference
# sequence.     We are using reference human assembly build 36.  Note that it is possible
# that data downloaded at different times may be different due to ongoing improvements
# in our ability to call genotypes. More information about these changes can be found at:
