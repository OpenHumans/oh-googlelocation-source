## Will my data be publicly available?
The short answer: No, by uploading your *Google Location History* file you don't agree to make your data public or give anyone access to this data. It will be stored in your account and you decide with whom to share.

The longer answer: It can be public if you want it to be public. If you're logged in into *Open Humans* you can [head to your personal data page, and make individual sources publicly available](https://www.openhumans.org/member/me/data/). If that's too much genome sharing for you, you can also [see if there are individual projects or studies with which you want to share your genome](https://www.openhumans.org/explore-share/).
