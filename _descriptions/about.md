# Upload your Google Location History data to *Open Humans*
If you are collecting your Location data through Google Maps' Location History data and your phone,
you can export all of this data via Google Takeout.
By uploading your Google Location History data to *Open Humans* you can use this data
to share it with projects or analyze it with [Personal Data Notebooks](https://juno-exploratory.herokuapp.com/).

To get started all you have to do is login into *Open Humans*, authorize this
integration and upload your *Google Location History* takeout.  

Some of your questions should be answered in our FAQ.

## How-to get in touch:
This *Open Humans* project is hosted and run by the *Open Humans* team.

## Which data do you store about me?
